# Setup
To install this anticheat to your realm/world you need to install the .mcpack and apply it to your world, then it should be fully up and running!
It is still in the beta stage, so stuff is still being added to it, and this is by no means the finished version (it will have bugs) - if you want to help me in the making of Polar Anticheat,
my discord is **Glitch#8024**.

# Features for Experienced Staff

+ Using a structure block, you can have a specific structure spawn when the player dies. First, the name to put in a structure block is ```gravestone```, then build whatever you want in it (maybe a cool gravestone, or a spike) and whenever a player dies, the structure will spawn on their death spot. You can even get complicated with this, and summon an armor stand for some cool custom death effects (like lightning or a blood burst)!
+ The same as above works for custom kill structures/effects as well, but this time the name to put in a structure block is ```pvpkillspot```. You are even able to make your own special systems with it.
+ This addon can detect many different player actions, including moving, gliding, left clicking, sprinting, sneaking, is on ground, levitatin, deaths, kills, what armor they are wearing, if their armor is enchanted, and a few smaller ones. You can use all of these for your own systems, like a system to only let people wearing enchanted diamond armor ender an area. The command for that system (just the chesplate) would be: ```/testfor @a[r=10,scores={detect_chest=5,ench_chest=1}]```
+ Its possible to create your own actionbar message with commands - if you want to use kills, deaths, or time played use this for reference: ```{"score":{"name": "@s","objective": "kills"}}``` ```{"score":{"name": "@s","objective": "deaths"}}``` ```{"score":{"name": "@s","objective": "timeplayeddy"}},{"text":":"},{"score":{"name": "@s","objective": "timeplayedhr"}},{"text":":"},{"score":{"name": "@s","objective": "timeplayedmin"}},{"text":":"},{"score":{"name": "@s","objective": "timeplayedsec"}}```
+ If you own a server with over 10,000 players, you can request a specific version from me on discord: **Glitch#8024** - I'll usually be happy to help customize!
